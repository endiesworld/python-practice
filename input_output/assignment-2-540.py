Using conditionals (if-then-else) and exception-handling

Your code should accept the (unsorted) first and last names of 9 students and then randomly combine sets of three students into the same group. Then, your code should display the three groups of students.

To make sure the student assignment is random, we apply a simple rule. If students' names are to be sorted based on last names, then any two students following each other in the sorted array cannot be in the same group.  

Please submit the .py file(s) when done
