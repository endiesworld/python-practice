# Understanding Variable Assignment in Python vs. Java/C++
#Python (Pass-by-Object-Reference)
    In Python, everything is an object, and variables are references (pointers) to objects in memory.
    When you pass a list to a function, you pass a reference to the original object, but reassigning the reference inside the function does not affect the callerâ€™s list.

#C++ and Java (Pass-by-Value and Reference Differences)
    In C++, when you pass an array (or a reference), modifying it inside a function affects the original.
    In Java, arrays are passed as references, similar to Python, but assignment (arr = newArray) behaves differently because Java variables are more like pointers.
